In order to account for these qualitative questions, we will consider the average user rating of each laptop in our evaluation of data.',
        'just': 'For most students, a good recommendation from previous users is worth more than the best marketing claims. Conversely, very rarely can great marketing convince a student to purchase a poorly reviewed laptop. Because students rely so heavily on user reviews when making a purchase, it will be the second standard we use to judge the laptops.'

Being in college involves lots of walking, especially getting to school and between classes. The last thing you want is to carry a dumbbell across campus.',
        'just': 'Weight is very important. As previously said most of the time with your computer will involve walking or lifting, rather than programming. Especially when combined with other books it can be quite a burden. When you move off campus you will be very glad that you have a laptop that is light weight. After 10 lbs we assume that you really do not care about weight and so all get a score of 0 beyond this point.'
